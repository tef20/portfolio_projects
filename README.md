# Welcome to my portfolio!  

My name is Chris and I've been learning to code (self-guided, part-time) for just over a year.
Here you'll find:
* **Projects** -- my small _but growing_ collection of personal projects, designed to showcase my progression as a programmer!  
* **Courses** -- details and links to some of the great courses I've taken, as well as further repositories containing that work  
* **Bookshelf** -- some topical books I've read and enjoyed :)  

Thank you for taking the time to look around!

## Projects

### Monty Hall  

The goal of this project was to build an interactive game inspired by [The Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) -- a probability puzzle based on the classic, counterintuitive television game-show, Let's Make a Deal, whose host was Monty Hall.

## Courses

Having completed a Diploma in Linguistics at the University of Manchester, where I enjoyed modules on syntax, logic, and statistics, I have been using my spare time to pursue the following online courses:

* **Introduction to CS (Harvard, CS50x)**
  * Very popular, well polished intro to CS fundamentals - I focused on first 4 weeks, to gain some familiarity with C language  
  * [Course page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2019/)  
* **Introduction to Linux (Linux Foundation, LFS101x)** 
  * Quite a broad introduction to the Linux ecosystem and some of the common systems and tools, from grep and awk to virtual machines
  * [Course page](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/)  
* **The Missing Semester (MIT)**
  * A student lead module covering effective use of computer tools often passed over in standard curricula; eg. bash, ssh, git, vim, tmux, basic privacy good practice, etc.  
  * [Course page](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/ )

## Bookshelf

Some of the awesome pop science books that inspired me to to learn more about computers:
* **The Code Book by Simon Singh** -- an engaging history of ideas in cryptography; tells some great stories of the back and forth between code makers and breakers, introducing techniques such as Cesar shift, Vigenère ciphers, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, RSA, PGP, and even some speculations on quantum cryptography.
* **Code by Charles Petzold** -- a very unique guide to the fundamental workings of modern(ish) computers, using essentially everyday objects to build an intuition for computer hardware and create a computer from the ground up. 
* **The Information by James Gleick** -- my first true introduction to information theory, absolutely blew my mind!
* **The Dream Machine by M. Mitchell Waldrop** -- on the institutional history of the American computer industry and the development of personal computing. Vannevar Bush, Norbert Wiener, Von Neumann, Claude Shannon, Alan Turing, JC Licklider, Doug Engelbart, etc.
